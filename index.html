        <h1>Happy Second Monthsary, My Love!</h1>
        <p>
            i know we’ve been missing each other a lot lately because we both have a lot on our plate, but either way, i appreciate you for still doing your best to talk to me. this website is purely html XD obviously, i’m not knowledgeable yet about advanced coding languages, but yeah, anyway, i’ll also use this website to share my appreciation message for you, just added some extra steps as well hehe. the process was actually fun. 
        </p>
        <p>
            happy second month to forever, rez. it still feels surreal that we’re together, that i get to call you, my soulmate, mine. no matter how much time passes, even when we are already celebrating our 50th anniversary, i don’t think i’ll ever fully grasp the depth of what we have. there were so many chances for our paths to never cross, so many ways we could’ve missed each other, yet here we are. and it doesn’t feel like coincidence. it feels like fate, as if the universe aligned just right so that, in this infinite timeline of possibilities, we would find each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            and maybe it’s cliché to say this, but my heart beats for you, rez. i don’t know how else to explain it. you’ve shown me how beautiful life can be, how even the smallest things can hold so much meaning. you’re the reason i’ve been able to see life through a lens of purpose and serenity, you keep my hope alive. i hope that i am also able to do the same for you. even on the hardest days, even when my heart aches in silence, i still find myself believing in the beauty of life, because you exist, and that is enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            of all the things that make me believe we are meant for each other, one that stands out the most is how deeply curiosity connects us. the award you received last sunday perfectly captures the way you see the world, how you are always seeking and eager to learn. and in the same way you search for knowledge and meaning in everything around you, i find myself just as eager to learn about you. until our 100th monthsary, and every moment beyond, i will still want to learn about you, with you, and from you. there will never come a day when my curiosity about you fades, when i stop wanting to uncover the depths of your thoughts, your dreams, your heart. i will always listen, not just with my ears, but with my soul. because as celine once said in before sunrise, the act of trying to understand someone, of sharing a part of yourself with them, is truly something magical, and the attempt in itself is very meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
            i promise you, with every beat of my heart, that i will never leave your side, despite any circumstances. thank you, not just for the things you do for me, but thank you for allowing me to love you, to cherish you, to express all that my heart holds. loving you is a privilege i will never take for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
            but love, to me, is more than just a feeling, it is an action, a devotion, a promise. and so, i vow to always love you not just in words but in every possible way. in the simple moments and the grand gestures, in the way i listen, in the way i support you, in the way i choose you, every single day. you deserve a love that is unyielding and assuring, one that does not falter in the face of difficulty but only grows stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
            and because you deserve the best kind of love, you inspire me to be more—to become someone better, someone worthy of standing beside you in this journey. i want to embody magis in our love, loving you is not just about feeling deeply but about acting on that love with intention, with effort, with the kind of devotion that stands the test of time.
        </p>
        <p> 
            you once told me i am like a star, and the way you described what that meant was truly meaningful to me. not to make this a competition or anything, but to me, you are my universe. the dictionary defines the universe as all of space, time, and everything within it. in other words, the universe is everything—and you are my everything.  
        </p>
        <p>
            when you look up at the stars, can you imagine their end? i can't. i see constellations stretching endlessly, galaxies unfolding one after another. i can't picture a sky where the stars suddenly cease to exist, where there's nothing but an infinite wall of darkness. in my mind, they go on forever. and just like that, my love for you never stops. it goes on and on and on. 
        </p>
